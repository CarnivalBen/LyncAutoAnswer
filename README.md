Lync 2012 Super Simple Auto Answer Video Kiosk with Full Screen, son.
==============
Lots more info at http://lyncautoanswer.com, be sure to visit.

I have a machine at my remote office in Seattle that is dedicated to Lync Video. For whatever reason the Lync folks don't include basic checkbox options like "Auto Answer" and "Start Video Automatically when someone calls" and "Make Video Fullscreen."

I have [dozens of articles on my blog dedicated to Remote Work setup](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CategoryView.aspx?category=Remote+Work) that I hope you check out.

So, I did all that myself using the Lync SDK. Which is a nightmare. But it's done, so that's something.

Feel free to have fun with the code, but I only guarantee that it "Works on My Machine.&copy;&trade;"

A special nod to the [InputSimulator project on CodePlex](http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/), as I'm using his excellent library. I'm also using the [Lync 2010 Client Developer SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18898).
